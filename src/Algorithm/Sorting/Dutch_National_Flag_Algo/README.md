# Dutch National Flag Algorithm

The algorithm derives its name from the flag of the Netherlands, which consists of three colors - white, red and blue, and its association with the famous problem of sorting balls of these colors.

Another version of this problem is to sort 0, 1, and 2's in an array, which can be solved in just linear time and constant space using this algorithm.

Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: o(1)
