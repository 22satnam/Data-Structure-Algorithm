Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

Cycle sort is a comparison sorting algorithm that forces array to be factored into the number of cycles where each of them can be rotated to produce a sorted array. It is theoretically optimal in the sense that
it reduces the number of writes to the original array.

It is an in-place and unstable sorting algorithm. Cycle sort forces an array to be factored into a number of cycles where every element can rotate in order to produce a sorted array.

# Working of Cycle sort Algorithm
Now, let's see the working of Cycle sort Algorithm. To understand the working of cycle sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array.

Let the elements of array are - {30, 20, 10, 40, 60, 50}
