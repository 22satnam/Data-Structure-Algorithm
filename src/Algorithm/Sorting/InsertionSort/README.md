# Algorithm

1. The first element is assumed to be sorted
2. Take the second element and mark it as the key
3. Compare it with the first element if it is smaller, place it first
4. Take the third element and compare it with the previous two elemets.
5. Continue the same procedure for all the n elements.

# Time Complexity

Best case: O(n)
Worst case: O(n^2)
